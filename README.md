This is a team project with four members in total.
We are creating the code needed to play the classic game 'battleships'.

The focus is on creating a 'board' and a 'player'. The game will eventually be played with Telnet.

We had a little fun and replaced 'ships' with 'sheep'. 'Players' are known instead as 'farmers'. The 'board' is a 'farm', and 'water' is 'grass'. But these are just name changes; our game still adheres to traditional battleship rules.
